 Test plan ID: 
	The name of test plan document for future reference.
		TP_v1.0

 Introduction: 
	About corresponding project requirements or functionality

 Test items: 
	The names of all Testings need to perform on current build
		=> [System Testing, API testing, DB-Testing ---etc]
	

 Feature to be tested: 
	The names of requirements or functionality to be test.
	=> Admin Module [Creation, Updation, Delection]

 Feature not to be tested: 
	=> The names of tested requirements
	=> The names of requirements part of other team members
	=> The names of testings optional under current release
	[Performance Testing, UnitTesting, Integation Testing  --etc]

  Candidates list:-->
	The names of the users who is responsible to perform testing
	=> The names of the users and their roles  and responsibilities.


 Test environment: 
	Required H/w and S/w to use in testing.  
	[Browser Name &  Browser version  &  Operating system]
	[Testenvironment will be setup before start system testing]

 Entry criteria: 
	[To start test execution]
 	Test cases prepared and reviewed after training sessions.
	Real test data received from client
	Test environment established by H/w team (computers S/w & H/w).
 	Received s/w build from developers.

Suspension criteria: 
	[To interrupt test execution]
	Test environment Problems (H/w problem)
	Software is not working.
	More defects are in pending by developers.

Resumption criteria:-->
	[When to resume suspended execution]
	After Environment Problemes fixed
	Previously reported defects has been fixed
	
Exit criteria: 
	(To stop test execution)
	All requirement in s/w are tested
	Test duration exceeded
	95% testcase passed
 	All major defects should be re-solved
	[Take screenshot of each test pass/fail]

 Test deliverables: 
	The list of testing documents to be prepared by 
	test engineer for future reference 
	[Test scenarios, test cases, test logs, defect reports....]
	[Daily Status Reports, Weekly Status Reports, MOM reports]

 Resource Training: 
	The names of selected test engineers for the 
	corresponding project testing and required no. 
	Of training sessions for them to understand 
	customers requirements.

Roles and Responsibilities:

	The work allocation to testing team
	[According to their technical skill] 

 Schedules: 
	The dates and time to be followed by test engineers.
	Future build release dates and schedules.

 Risks & Assumptions:
	assumptions: The previously analyzed list of risks 
	and solutions to overcome.
	
	What if time is exceeded?
	Perform Informal testings [Adhoc Testing]

	What if client not specified requirement?
	Perform exploraroty testing 

 Approvals: 
	Approvals from PM.

Ques:--> Do you have experience into test plan developement
	 No, [It is a test lead job]
	 But i know what testplan contains..


Que:--> Do you involve in test plan?
	Yes, I followed Testplan to Condcut Software Testing
